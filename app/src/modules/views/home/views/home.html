		I’m standing up and I'm telling you, I am Warhol. I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare, in the flesh. Walt Disney, Nike, Google... Now who's going to be the Medici Family and stand up and let me create more? Or do you want to marginalize me until I’m out of my moment?
